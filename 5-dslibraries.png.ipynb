    "Here are some of the most popular libraries used in data science:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pandas** - A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures like DataFrames.\n",
    "2. **NumPy** - Offers support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical functions.\n",
    "3. **Matplotlib** - A plotting library used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.\n",
    "4. **Seaborn** - Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn is used for making attractive and informative statistical graphics.\n",
    "5. **Scikit-learn** - A robust machine learning library for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "6. **TensorFlow** - An open-source platform for machine learning and deep learning developed by Google.\n",
    "7. **Keras** - A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow.\n",
    "8. **PyTorch** - An open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab, widely used for deep learning tasks.\n",
    "9. **SciPy** - Used for scientific computing and technical computing, extending NumPy with additional modules for optimization, integration, and statistics.\n",
    "10. **NLTK** - The Natural Language Toolkit is a leading platform for building Python programs that work with human language data.\n"
